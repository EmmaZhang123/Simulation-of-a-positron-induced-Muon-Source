# Simulation of a positron induced Muon Source
This is the final project of Laboratory of Computational Physics (mod. A)

## Language: 
Python

## Description:
Muon beams are used in high-energy physics experiments to study subatomic particles and their interactions. 
The production of a high brillance muon beam is one of the most important challenge for the future of Particle Physics.
To mimize the divergence of the resulting "muon beam", the positrons energy is chosen so that the reaction occurs close 
to threshold (assuming the electrons in the target to be at rest). 
The main goal of this project is to produce a Monte Carlo simulation of such a process.
